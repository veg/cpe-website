Maciej Boni, an epidemiologist with 20 years of experience, participated in a debate with Braver Angels, Wilk Wilkinson, and David Zweig regarding the primary and secondary effects of the first year of the pandemic (March 2020 - March 2021).

Key points from the debate:

*   **Primary effects:** 540,000 deaths in the first year.
*   **Secondary effects:** One year of learning loss for kids, unemployment, and isolation.
*   **Nature of the emergency:** In March 2020, half a million people were about to die. More than a million could have died in the first year.
*   **School opening and viral transmission:** COVID cases increased by 10-15% in partially open schools and 30% in fully open schools compared to closed schools.
*   **Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs):** Masks and bans on large gatherings helped reduce COVID cases. States with stronger messaging and better compliance generally had fewer COVID deaths. Alaska and Utah "overperformed" among red-voting states, but 8 out of 10 best-performing states were blue-voting states.

The video of the debate is available at: [https://lnkd.in/eaZ9AVBt](https://lnkd.in/eaZ9AVBt). Specific time stamps are mentioned for discussions on primary/secondary risks (41:45-44:00), school transmission (53:00-58:00), and state-level NPI effectiveness (18:00-21:00).
