Dr. Ananias Escalante is a Full Professor in the Department of Biology and a core faculty member of the Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine (iGEM) at Temple University. His research focuses on the intersection of epidemiology, ecology, and evolution, particularly in understanding the genetic diversity, distribution, and adaptation of parasites, including human and non-human malaria. He investigates how ecological factors and natural selection influence these aspects, and how drug resistance emerges. His work aims to improve disease intervention strategies and control infectious diseases.
