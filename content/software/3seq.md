**Description:** 3SEQ is a method for detecting recombination signals in DNA sequence alignments. It identifies triplets of sequences where two sequences are more closely related to each other in a specific region of the alignment than they are to the third sequence, suggesting a recombination event.

**Use in Pathogen Evolution:** In the context of pathogen evolution, 3SEQ is used to:
*   **Screen for recombination:** Quickly screen large datasets of pathogen sequences to identify potential recombination events. It is particularly useful for exploratory analysis and identifying regions of interest for further investigation.
*   **Support recombination hypotheses:** Provide statistical support for recombination events detected by other methods or inferred from phylogenetic incongruence.
*   **Understand recombination hotspots:** Identify genomic regions that are prone to recombination in pathogens.
