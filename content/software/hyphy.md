**Description:** HyPhy (Hypothesis testing using Phylogenies) is a software package for the analysis of molecular sequences using phylogenetic methods. It provides a wide range of statistical methods for testing evolutionary hypotheses, particularly selection pressure, recombination, and molecular clock models, using phylogenetic trees.

**Use in Pathogen Evolution:** HyPhy is extensively used to study pathogen evolution by:
*   **Detecting natural selection:** Identifying genes or sites under positive or negative selection, which is crucial for understanding how pathogens adapt to their hosts and environments.
*   **Analyzing evolutionary rates:** Estimating the rate of evolution in different lineages or genes of pathogens, helping to understand their adaptation and spread.
*   **Inferring recombination:** Detecting and characterizing recombination events in pathogen genomes, which is is a significant mechanism of pathogen evolution and drug resistance.
*   **Testing molecular clock models:** Evaluating the temporal signal in pathogen sequences to understand their evolutionary history and timescale.
