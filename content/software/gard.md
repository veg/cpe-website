**Description:** GARD (Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection) is a method implemented within HyPhy for detecting recombination breakpoints in sequence alignments. It uses a genetic algorithm to search for the optimal placement of breakpoints that minimize the phylogenetic incongruence across different genomic regions.

**Use in Pathogen Evolution:** GARD is specifically used in pathogen evolution to:
*   **Identify recombination events:** Accurately detect and locate recombination breakpoints in pathogen genomes. Recombination is a major driver of evolution in many pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, allowing for rapid adaptation and the emergence of novel strains.
*   **Characterize mosaic structures:** Understand the mosaic structure of recombinant pathogen genomes, which is essential for tracking the origins and spread of recombinant variants.
*   **Improve phylogenetic inference:** By accounting for recombination, GARD can help to generate more accurate phylogenetic trees for pathogens, leading to better evolutionary and epidemiological analyses.
