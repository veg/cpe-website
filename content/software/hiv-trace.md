**Description:** HIV-TRACE (HIV-TRansmission Analysis by Co-occurrence of Evolutionarily-similar sequences) is a tool designed for identifying potential HIV transmission clusters from large sequence databases. It uses phylogenetic methods to analyze HIV sequences and identify groups of sequences that are closely related, suggesting recent transmission links.

**Use in Pathogen Evolution:** HIV-TRACE is specifically tailored for studying HIV transmission dynamics and evolution by:
*   **Inferring transmission clusters:** Identifying groups of individuals likely linked by direct or indirect HIV transmission, which is crucial for understanding HIV epidemiology and designing targeted interventions.
*   **Analyzing transmission networks:** Mapping potential HIV transmission networks to understand patterns of spread and identify high-risk populations or transmission routes.
*   **Monitoring epidemic dynamics:** Tracking the evolution and spread of HIV over time and geographically, providing insights into epidemic trends and the impact of interventions.
