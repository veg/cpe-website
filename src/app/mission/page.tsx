          The Center for Pathogen Evolution at Temple University is dedicated to advancing public health through innovative, interdisciplinary research on pathogen evolution. By integrating evolutionary bioinformatics, epidemiology, and mathematical modeling, we strive to understand the fundamental principles of pathogen adaptation, predict and prepare for emerging infectious diseases, and develop evidence-based strategies for disease prevention, control, and treatment.
